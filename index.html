  <h1>Rashid Ibrahim</h1>
  <p style="margin : 0; padding-top:0;"> </em> Software Engineer Intern at Activision Blizzard</em> </p>
  <p>I am a junior studying CSSE at University of Washington.
    I enjoy solving problems and using logic more than designing and styling. I am an analytical, investigative person who is always curious and hungry for learning more.
    Outside school, I like hiking in my free time, and I am interested in how to utilize technology to do good for people around the world.</p>
